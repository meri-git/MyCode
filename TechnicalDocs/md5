The MD5 algorithm, which produces a 128-bit hash value, does not have a defined maximum length for input strings. It can theoretically process an input of up to

 −1 bits, which is about 2 exabytes (2^64 bits). In practical terms, this means that MD5 can handle input strings that are extremely large, far beyond typical use cases. However, there are practical constraints such as memory and computational resources that would limit the actual size of the input string you can process on a given system.
