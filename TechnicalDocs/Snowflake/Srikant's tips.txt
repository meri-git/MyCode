I have purchased one Practice set in Udemy.

In my exam, 20 to 30 questions were straight forward
around 30 questions, we can answer by using elimination technique
few questions were very big with each option in 2 to 3 lines

Some Important topics to refer documentation:
	- Security (There were couple of questions on MFA)
	- TimeTravel & Fail-Safe
	- Micro-Paritions
	- Clustering
	- Data Loading (Look into Copy, Put commands. Also Bulk Loading, Snowpipe)
	- Account_Usage Vs Information schema
	- Virtual Warehouses configuration(Auto_Scale, Maximized, Scaleup/down, ScaleOut/In)
	- Roles (Got few questions on Accountadmin)
	- Snowflake Editions (Mainly focus on features available in each edition)
	- Data Sharing (I have see 5 to 6 questions on this topic)
